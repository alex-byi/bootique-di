== Injector

`Injector` is an entry point for all DI-managed objects.
Injector allows getting configured services directly or via a lazy provider.
You can get services by their binding keys.

[source,java]
----
Injector injector = ...;

// get directly by the class
Worker worker = injector.getInstance(Worker.class);

// get by the key
Key<Service<Integer>> serviceKey = Key.get(new TypeLiteral<Service<Integer>>(){});
Provider<Service<Integer>> serviceProvider = injector.getProvider(serviceKey);
----

Also, the `Injector` API contains some useful methods for container retrospection.

* `injector.hasProvider()` method allows checking presence of the binding.
* `injector.getKeysByType()` method returns collection of key bound to given type, regardless of additional qualifiers.
